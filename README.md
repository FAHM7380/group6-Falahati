## Introduction
In order to adjust the building expenses, each building manager must calculate all the small expenses and how to divide each of them, and also report to the building occupants at the end of the bill, charge, financial balance, etc. All of this is time consuming for one person and organizing the whole paper and work invoice and it is very difficult to handle. Therefore, in the age of technology, various programs and software have been written to facilitate the work and organize these costs, one of which is our project (اسقف team), which helps the building manager to eliminate all additional building costs. And give only general expenses to the program.Our program consists of three parts:1.Input(append fanc) 2.div(division func) 3.report func
In the input section(append fanc), the building manager only needs to record the total costs of the building and in the other two sections, the costs of each unit in the ways specified by the manager, such as the aggregate cost chart, financial balance and invoices of the units, etc. Shows.
